# cli-tasks-app 📝

This is my first CLI app on node and allow you to manage your tasks by using the terminal and a couple of commands.

### Funtions
1. Create task
2. list all tasks
3. list tasks done
4. list tasks to do
5. Mark tasks as done
6. Remove task
0. Exit

if you wanna use this project all you have to do is download this repository and run a few commands, here are the commands.

`git clone https://github.com/andrewakosta/cli-tasks-app.git`

and run the `app.js` file

`node app.js`

then you're gonna see something like the following imagen.
